# Node Blockchain

### A simple blockchain implementation in node and typescript

This started as a guided project from https://github.com/fireship-io/node-blockchain as of now, but I plan to make it into a full fledged project
once I get done with the ts, node, ex, mdb and rest of the tech.

## How To Use

1. Go to index.ts and uncomment line 116 to 125
2. use ` >npm run start ` start to start the 3-transaction example
