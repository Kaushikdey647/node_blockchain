# Node Blockchain

### A simple blockchain implementation in node and typescript

This started as a guided project from https://github.com/fireship-io/node-blockchain as of now, but I plan to make it into a full fledged project
once I get done with the ts, node, ex, mdb and rest of the tech.

## How To Use

1. Go to index.ts and uncomment line 116 to 125
2. use ` > npm install ` to fix stuff
3. use ` > npm run start ` start to start the 3-transaction example

## About the Project

This is in a very early phase. Inspired by the video above, this is a blockchain implementation on a node.js framework coded in typescript.
The idea is to create an api that takes transaction requests and manages a secure wallet system.

## How to Contribute

This is a very very early stage so I am not considering branches here, just commit changes to the main branch
